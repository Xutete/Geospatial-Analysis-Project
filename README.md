# 💡 Conclusions
* With an average Age of 27, around 6000 incidents have happened.
* Clearly from the 1990s, the incidents are on the rise.
* 141 is the highest Number of Incidents that happened in a year and 21 is the highest Number of Fatalities.
* From Fatality Ratio vs Shark Incidents, we can make inferences like - Shark Incidents for Great White Shark are much larger than all other Sharks.
* Majority number of Incidents happened in the USA, but fatalities happened mostly in Australia.
* Most incidents were caused by Swimming and Diving activity.
* Male gender has gone through more incidents. However, in terms of the Fatality ratio, there is not much difference between both genders. Males have around 25.9% and Females have 20.2%.
